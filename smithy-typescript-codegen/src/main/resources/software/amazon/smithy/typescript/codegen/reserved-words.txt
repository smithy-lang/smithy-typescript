# TypeScript reserved words.
#
# Smithy's rules around the names of types are already pretty strict and
# mostly compatible with TypeScript's naming conventions. Furthermore, the
# code generator will automatically uppercase every instance where a
# TypeScript type is generated from a Smithy type. This makes the majority
# of all of the reserved words in TypeScript something that will never be
# encountered when generating code. However, it's possible that other
# SymbolProvider implementations could be used that do emit reserved
# words for identifiers, hence this code is useful as an extra layer of
# protection.
*
# Various built-in types defined by JavaScript and/or TypeScript are
# included in the set of reserved words (for example, Pick). This
# should prevent most conflicts with built-in types based on the information
# available as of today (September, 2019), however, the list of built-in
# types available in TypeScript are likely to grow over time. Adding new
# reserved words to this list when new TypeScript types are added could
# potentially result in a breaking change to previously generated clients,
# so adding new reserved words is discouraged. Ideally we could have just
# automatically added an alias for built-in types that conflict with
# generated types, but, unfortunately, it's not currently possible to
# alias a built-in TypeScript or JavaScript type.
#
# When a reserved word is encountered, this implementation will
# continue to prefix the word with "_" until it's no longer considered
# reserved.
