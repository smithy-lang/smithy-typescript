# TypeScript reserved words for members.
#
# Smithy's rules around the names of types are already pretty strict and
# mostly compatible with TypeScript's naming conventions. Furthermore, the
# code generator will automatically uppercase every instance where a
# TypeScript type is generated from a Smithy type. This makes the majority
# of all of the reserved words in TypeScript something that will never be
# encountered when generating code. However, it's possible that other
# SymbolProvider implementations could be used that do emit reserved
# words for identifiers, hence this code is useful as an extra layer of
# protection.
#
# Adding new reserved words to this list could potentially result in a
# breaking change to previously generated clients, so adding new reserved words
# is discouraged. Ideally we could have just automatically added an alias for
# built-in types that conflict with generated types, but, unfortunately, it's
# not currently possible to alias a built-in TypeScript or JavaScript type.
#
# When a reserved word is encountered, this implementation will
# continue to prefix the word with "_" until it's no longer considered
# reserved.

# Prevent prototype pollution
